Overview
Give a man a cookie . . . and heâ€™s yours.
 
 Melody Monroe will do anything to get her nine-year-old twin boys to muster up the holiday spirit. Especially since they lost their father, the boys have started questioning the point of Christmas at all.
 
 When Melody learns the schoolâ€™s cookie committee has disbanded due to dissension in the top ranks, she canâ€™t let the boys lose another ounce of Christmas joy, so she decides to take over the cookie committee herself, even if it means dealing with the infuriating school principal, Jonathan Braxton.
 
 Soon, a small argument turns into a town-wide bake-off between her and Jonathan, and before she knows it Melody finds that her competitive spirits have turned romantic. Love isnâ€™t supposed to be in the recipe for Melody. But with a little holiday magic, she and Jonathan might just bake up something special.
