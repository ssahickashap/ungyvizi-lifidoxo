Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Weâ€™ve said it before and weâ€™ll say it again: Katee Robertâ€™s modern-day deconstructions of our favorite Greek myths are dark, sexy and alluring. This B&amp;N Exclusive Edition contains a bonus scene from Hera and Zeusâ€™s wedding and wedding night. He was my enemy. My lover. My husband. And the one man I swore by all Olympus I would destroy. *A scorchingly hot modern retelling of Aphrodite and Hephaestus (and Pandora and Adonis).* Aphrodite has never flinched at getting her perfectly manicured hands dirty, and she&#039;s not about to start nowâ€”even if that means marrying Olympus&#039;s enemy number one, the new Hephaestus. She has a wicked plan to keep her deadly new husband off-balance, seducing the one person he seems to care about most in this world: Pandora, a woman as beautiful as she is sweet. Two can play the seduction game, however, and Hephaestus is all too happy to put his new wife in her place. Her ex, Adonis, seems like he&#039;ll do the trick. It doesn&#039;t hurt that he&#039;s gorgeous in the way of fallen angels, either. The only problem with using seduction as a weapon? Hearts are all too quick to get involved. With Hephaestus and Aphrodite trading venomous strikes that feel a whole lot like foreplay, lines become blurred and emotions entangled.Â But a broken heart may be the least of their worries. With unrest in Olympus reaching new heights, these bedroom games may have deadly consequences for themselves, their city, and everyone they&#039;ve come to love. &quot;Deliciously inventiveâ€¦Red-hot.&quot;â€”Publishers Weekly STARRED Review for Neon Gods &quot;I get shivers just thinking of their interactions.
