Overview
The fifth installment of the graphic novel adaptation of Cassandra Clareâ€™s bestselling The Mortal Instruments! On a mission to save her mom, Clary prepares to leave for Idris, the homeland of the Shadowhunters. Sure, Jace is adamantly against the idea and Magnus refuses to help, but Clary now has powers of her own. What awaits her on the other side of the portal, though, might not be exactly what sheâ€™s expecting... The city comes to life through Cassandra Jeanâ€™s lush artwork, and a scene penned by Cassandra Clare exclusively for the graphic novel makes this a canâ€™t-miss for fans!
