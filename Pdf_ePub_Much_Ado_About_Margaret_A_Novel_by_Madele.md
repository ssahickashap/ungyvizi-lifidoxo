Madeleine Rouxâ€™s next season in Regency England follows a rebellious writer and the man who risks everything to publish her.
 
 Margaret Arden yearns to live like the passionate and daring women in her novel. The idyllic life at Mosely Cottage with her two younger sisters and mother is fine, but Margaret wants more than the demure and dainty existence sheâ€™s known. After a particularly brutal rejection from an annoyingly attractive publisher, Margaret fears being forced into marriage to protect her family if their financial situation doesnâ€™t improveâ€”until her cousinâ€™s glamorous wedding masquerade brings her onto a collision course with scandal, notoriety, and even love.Â 
 
 Captain Bridger Darrow is starting over after fighting for his country. Now home, he is struggling to save his family from destitution and succeed in a new venture of passion: book publishing. Itâ€™s all going rather poorly, until he stumbles upon loose pages of an astonishing novel while in attendance at his dearest friendâ€™s wedding. Bridger knows he must publish it. But upon meeting the author, Bridger is stunned to discover that heâ€”sheâ€”is a woman, and he has already told her off in grand fashion.
 
 While Bridger is keen to gain her trust and rescind the initial rejection, Margaret canâ€™t help but be skeptical of his intentions. Sparks fly between the two, just as the wedding of the season starts to descend into chaos when a masked dance leads to a case of mistaken identities.
